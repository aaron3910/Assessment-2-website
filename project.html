            <p class="text-center">Team 404 are producing an innovative application to help people confined to a wheelchair, improving their physical health while also taking care of their mental health. </p>
            <p class="text-center">Being&nbsp; confined to a wheelchair makes day to day activities extremely difficult, and ontop of these struggles, Exercise also becomes harder, which can increase weight and&nbsp; can lead to other health issues. Not only is it difficult to exercise but it also takes a lot of stamina and strength to get around in a wheelchair and complete day to day tasks by yourself with no assistance. </p>

          <p>Motorvation© for this project comes from Team Member Josh Britton whoses eyes were opened as he was confided to a wheelchair for a small portion of time. This experience has showed Josh a whole new world and how different day to day tasks were that were once taken for granted in perfect health. TeamNAME hopes to be able to make this app with the desire of helping others that are confined to a wheelchair and hopefully helping and improving those lives.</p>

  <h2 class="text-center">Description</h2>
  <p>I want to make a app that is readily available to everyone but is directed to people that have gone through a incident that has left them in a wheelchair. I want this app to have a few different things to help. By having different exercises programs for people in chairs to do. Mainly because its not something you think about until it happens and then you don't really have a clue what to do. From there I would like to improve the app in different aspects to showing other everyday aspects that you have to learn i.e. Transferring to different surfaces, Assembling and disassembling your wheelchair, Cleaning and taking care of your wheelchair. To then also making a area for carers and loved ones so they can learn. Once i have a small group of people I would also love to be able to help them get in contact with other wheelchair users to help give tips or tricks to help each other.</p>
