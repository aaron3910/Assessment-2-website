            <h3>Tamara Taylor</h3>
            <p><strong><em>Senior Principal Industry Solution Architect</em></strong></p>
            <p><em><strong>Years of Experience:</strong></em> 15+</p>
            <p><strong><em>Company: </em></strong>DXC Technologies Eclipse Divison</p>

<div class="media-body">
          <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do? </h5>
              Mrs. Taylor stated that she conducts a variety of IT work through her senior position in the company. Fields of work that she is involved in currently includes; Business Needs Assessments for organizations that are undergoing digital transformation as well as ERP (Enterprise Requirements Planning) software implementations. She also deals with all areas of changes; whether it is software, procedural processes within the organization and with regards to people; her job also includes the ability for identification of skill sets and capabilities of an organization’s employees. Also, within her IT work she also performs mentoring and training of graduate students who have completed a bachelor’s degree in either IT, Supply Chain or Finance. Mrs. Taylor then stated that one of the most important keys to her work is a quote she uses when mentoring “Anyone can know a software, but if they can’t relate it to a business process it means nothing”. Further explained Mrs. Taylor stated that clients don’t understand language and the software, but they certainly understand the business process, so it is important in her work to translate the software’s terminology and parameters of the software to meet business needs.</div>

          <div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-12">
<div class="media-body">
          <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">2. Please tell us about the industry you work in. </h5>
Mrs. Taylor states she is in the IT Industry Service side, providing services to assist in ERP implementations from implement stages. Using a Waterfall method, these stages start at 1. Discovery where requirements are gathered. 2. Design – how do we want to make the system work for them. 3. Fit Gap Assessment – how many of the requirements are delivered by the standard functionality of the system through configuration, these are assessed based on whether it need to beheld in the ERP system or is there a work around, or is a modification needed to be designed and developed. 4. Configuration – building the system and set up of the system, specifically all systems have a different way of being set up and there are a variety of ways to set each system up. 5. Key User Training – based on the customer requirements and configuration, all staff must be trained. 6. User Testing – test the system to prove that the build of the system allows them to do their individual processes and run the business. 7.Live Support – provided to ensure any issues or problems are handled post implementation. Mrs. Taylor also stated that during this whole implementation stages a Data Migration process is conducted, gathering master static data out of an old system into a new system. Another form of work Mrs. Taylor mentioned was a project methodology known as AGILE. This method is highly customized systems, so the project is broken up into smaller projects known as SPRINTS that are implemented gradually every few weeks and each of these SPRINTS basically performs a Waterfall Method. Whilst this method is preferred for efficiency and less requirement of live support as the customer is exposed earlier to the configured and developed system. Mrs. Taylor then stated that her role is to oversee these projects and the impact that they can have on the functionality of the system, the timeline and also budget increases. She also handles customer issues, maintains the project path and in charge of providing the most reasonable solution with limited customization to benefit both the business and her company.</div>

She is the final interviewer for recruitment to determine employment of candidates, Senior Manager of a Delivery team that consists of 10 Solution Architects, 2 Industry Architects and 2 Project Delivery Architect.

        <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">5. Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals. </h5>
Industry Solution Bender (ISB) may have specific IP (Intellectual Property) so Mrs. Taylor collaborates with ISB’s about their IP and the probability that the customer could benefit from using their IP. She also interacts with the prime vender (Microsoft) as an advisor for particular functions within their solution. Due to her employers large scale organization Business Intelligence is an in house team that does this, so she also engages with them when the client needs BI or they have BI they are not using appropriately so that the team can come and assist the client to use them. Mrs. Taylor also interacts with Infrastructure Architects when dealing with new implementations even though it is cloud. </div>

        <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">7. What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these. </h5>
Mrs. Taylor stated she had too many areas to specify for the interview time, but primarily works on Industry Solution. She does global enterprise engagements which she explains that she has a team of Solution Architects that work in Europe and that their work does not conflict with other areas of the project in another Country for the company. Mrs. Taylor then simplifies this engagement as always putting forward the best practice business process and persuading other international business units within the organization to understand the best business process so that they can accept it also. Mrs. Taylor also determines a Roll Out Started for the client – which helps identify which business units need to go first based off a high level assessment of businesses and ensure that a struggling business unit has sufficient employers to take on board the project implementation. Mrs. Taylor was then asked to present a percentage of work she does and responded with: 50% of her time is on the solutioning elements, 25% of her time on customer relations (being a trusted advisor), 10-15% of her time Mentoring direct reports (people who report to her) and 10% Management Tasks and Business Management. </div>

      <div class="media-body">
        <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">8. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging? </h5>
Recruitment – the international resource of people of D365 Consultants is finite and actually limited with a massive shortage and the ones available are C or B grade consultants that only know the software and not the business component. Asking for too much money that cannot equate to a valuable that would be beneficial to the company. </div>

                <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry? </h5>
Mrs. Taylor stated that IT is such a broad topic, a lot of IT people that are system or network engineers that maintain systems and software. In Mrs. Taylor’s field of work, it’s IT delivering a software solution to budget, but it also streamlines the customer’s process. As a result of implementing BI with D365, these customers now have Realtime information not only on their liabilities but also on product costs to that they now become more marketable and know how much they can discount to be the winning business in their field. Also helps identify the profit margins accurately whereas before they hoped that the company retained a gross margin, whilst also showing which customer’s owe them the most money and how old the invoices are so trading terms are visible and when to expect payments to better control their cashflow.</div>
