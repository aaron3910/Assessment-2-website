                          <p>An autonomous car is a vehicle capable of sensing its environment and operating without human involvement. A human passenger is not required to take control of the vehicle at any time, nor is a human passenger required to be present in the vehicle at all.</p>
                          </p>An autonomous car can go anywhere a traditional car goes and do everything that an experienced human driver does. There are a few different levels of driving automation(see reference below)</p>
                          <img src="images/automotive-levels.jpg"><p>[1]</p>
                          <p>Autonomous vehicles are capable of driving on roads with other people who are manually driving cars they are also capable of following all road rules, they have ultrasonic sensors in the wheels that detect curbs and other objects while trying to park the vehicle.</p>
                          <p>The development of autonomous vehicles has progressed massively in the past decade, to the point where in the near future there will be automated trucks driving on highways.</p>
                          <p><strong>What is the state of the art of this new technology? </strong></p>
                          <p>Autonomous vehicles have been in development dating back as early as 1920, with the first car developed in the late 70s by a Japanese engineering team, today Tesla’s come with a feature called “autopilot” which is a system that relies on artificial intelligence, machine learning, algorithms and a plentiful of complex hardware such as cameras, sensors and software to tie it all together.</p>
                          <p>The funding on autonomous vehicles has seen billions in research and development, which has helped progress the advanced sensors they use, the last technology to be as lauded as autonomous vehicles was 3d printing, it has the potential to change the life of everybody on the planet, having a vehicle where you can just tell it where you want to go, and it’ll do the rest of the work.</p>
                         
                          <p><strong>What can be done now?</strong></p>
                          <p>Autonomous vehicles are already readily available to purchase, Tesla Model S/X/3 all come equipped with Tesla's inhouse developed software called “Autopilot”</p>
                          <p>Autopilot comes with adaptive cruise control, alerts(such as various road conditions, inattention from the driver), the ability to summon the car from your garage, auto parking, autosteering, various safety features like automatic emergency braking, speed assist which allows the car to read various speed signs and follow the speed limits, autopilot which allows automatic lane changing, moving to less congested lanes, exit highways and navigate freeway interchanges.</p>
                          
                          <p><strong>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
                          <p>According to Elon Musk, founder of Tesla</p>
                          <p>"We really designed the Model S to be a very sophisticated computer on wheels. Tesla is a software company as much as it is a hardware company. A huge part of what Tesla is, is a Silicon Valley software company. We view this the same as updating your phone or your laptop." Full autonomy is “really a software limitation: The hardware exists to create full autonomy, so it’s really about developing advanced, narrow AI for the car to operate on.“</p>
                          <p>The Autopilot development focus is on "increasingly sophisticated neural nets that can operate in reasonably sized computers in the car”. According to Musk, "the car will learn over time", including from other cars. [2]</p>
                          <p>FFord has invested over $1 billion into a startup company called Argo AI, created by former Google and uber employees, in which ford is planning on having “level 4” autonomous vehicles by 2021, level 4, meaning it’s basically a fully automated vehicle, but it might not go into unmapped areas, or drive during severe weather.</p>
                          
                          <p><strong>What technological or other developments make this possible?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
                          <p>The advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, optical vision systems such as the EyeQ chip from mobileEye which can recognise motorised vehicles like trucks, cars and motorbikes regardless of day or night conditions, in a single camera will continue to make autonomous cars cheaper and more widely available.</p>

                        </h5>
                      </div>
                      <div id="collapseTwo" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingTwo" data-parent="#accordion">

                          <p><strong> What is the potential impact of this development?</strong></p>
                          <p>A big impact that autonomous vehicles have the potential to do is that they will take jobs away from people in certain industries, since companies like Tesla are pushing automated trucks.
                            There are also various other automated vehicles that will take away from human jobs which are not limited to vehicles like automated forklifts,
                            there are also automated ride sharing services from uber, which take away jobs from the drivers including public transport such as buses.</p>
                          <p>&nbsp;<strong>What is likely to change? </strong></p>
                          <p>As research and development continues into the autonomous vehicles, we’ll likely start to see more widespread adoption of these vehicles into the general consumers,
                            as legislation allows them, which in turn will reduce the death toll statistics from the road, since AI cars are typically less accident prone than a human driven car,
                            however since the increasing amount of autonomous vehicles on the road, there has been a significant increase in pedestrian injuries from the autonomous vehicles.</p>

                          <p><strong> Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</strong></p>
                          <p>As stated above this has the potiental to make the following jobs redundent
                            <ul>
                            <li>Taxis/ride sharing</li>
                            <li>public transport such as buses</li>
                            <li>Truck driving</li>
                            <li>forklifts</li>
                            </ul>  
                            <p></p>
                          <p>There will be numerous new jobs created however as companies will continue to rely on AI and ML to advance the autonomous cars along with the hardware required to operate,
                            they will need to continue increasing the amount of staff they have to keep up with demand and/or competition. There has been reports into the amount of time humans will have
                            spare while not required to be behind the wheel while driving between locations,with estimates that driverless cars could contribute up to half a trillion dollars to the economy as a result of increased spare time.
                          </p>
                          
                          <p><strong>How will this affect you? In your daily life, how will this affect you? </strong></p>
                          <p>This has the potential to affect me in the coming years with the rise of autonomous vehicles growing rapidly, right now there will not be too much effect on most people,
                            but who knows what the future will bring, autonomous cars are here to stay and has could potentially change everybody's daily lives,
                            the amount of free time that will be produced as a side effect of owning of self driving car should allow a big spike in productivity,
                            whether this is used for personal hobbies such as reading, coding, writing etc, or used for work productivity while your commuting to work in your automated car,
                            it could make people I know in the ride sharing and truck industry redundant from their jobs as autonomous vehicles continue to rapidly progress in development
                            and as local legislation allows them to be used as fully automated level 5 vehicles. Using a self driving car however could have a big impact on your life,
                            by the way it may choose your life less valuable as the person who just crossed the road with a baby and choose to save them over yourself,
                            depending on the decision the artificial intelligence decides. “It’s a relatively straightforward ethical dilemma, as moral quandaries go.
                            And people overwhelmingly prefer to save human lives over animals, according to a massive new ethics study that asked people how a self-driving car should
                            respond when faced with a variety of extreme trade-offs — dilemmas to which more than 2 million people responded. But what if the choice is between two elderly people 
                            nd a pregnant woman? An athletic person or someone who is obese? Passengers vs. pedestrians?”[3]</p>
