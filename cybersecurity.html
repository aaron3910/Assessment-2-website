                        <p> Cyber Security is about protecting your technology and information from unauthorized access. Cyber-attacks have changed over time, Scattershot attacks designed for mischief and annoyance have now been swapped with threats and attacks on valuable information and data. </p>
                          <p> Advanced cyber-attacks succeed because they carefully planned and implemented by using a certain set of steps:</p>
                          <p>
							  <li>- Settle into the system and try and hide itself into files. </li> 
							  <li>- Search for any network vulnerabilities. </li> 
							  <li>- Disables any network security that it deems as a threat.</li> 
							  <li>- Inspects all the systems and devices on that network. </li> 
							  <li>- Calls back to the command computer or server. </li> 
							  <li>- Sits and waits for command to start extracting the critical data it's been sent for. </li>
							  <p>By the time most businesses or organizations realize that they have been attacked, it's been sitting there for weeks, months even years. 
							    Once the malware has sent the information back to the command computer the information can then be used in different ways depending on what information was taken. Some of the ways that the malware can become a threat depending what its be implanted for. </p>
							  <p><strong>Identity Theft. </strong></p>
							  <p>This is a threat that goes for all your personal information of the victims from social media such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter it the uses this information to construct who the victim is. If enough personal information is gathered it would allow a cyber-criminal to take you online identity and become you. </p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Password Attacks.</strong></p>
                            <p>This is a type of threat which involves the malware to attempt to hack any passwords that you have set up to gain access to the personal information. </p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Spyware and Keylogging</strong></p> 
                            <p>Spyware can spy on the computing habits of the victim. Some spyware such as keyloggers can record the targets keystrokes and gain information including: Passwords, Pin numbers, Credit card details and other confidential information. </p>
                            <p> There are 5 different types of security that are implemented in cyber security.</p>
                            <p><strong> 1.	Critical Infrastructure Security. </strong></p>
                            <p> Critical Infrastructure Security is the security of the systems that we rely on every day. For example, the power grid, traffic lights and hospitals. Having these things on the internet leaves them open for a cyber-attack at any time. </p>
                            <p><strong>2.	Application Security. </strong></p>
                            <p>Application Security is one of the most important ones this protects software and hardware from unwanted malware from different applications that you may use. So, examples of application security are Antivirus Programs, Firewalls and Encryption Programs.</p>
                            <p><strong>3.	Network Security.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Network security guards against unauthorized entry of your internal networks. Network security secures and protects by stopping access. Examples of implementing this are Having separate logins, password changes and using application security to help. </p>
                            <p><strong>4.	Cloud Security.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Cloud security is software based that protects and monitors the data in your cloud. Cloud providers are constantly creating and upgrading their security, so users have better protection. Alot of people tend to believe data is more secure when kept in a physical location like their own server or hard-drive but that is slowly not becoming true as cloud security is improving. </p>
                            <p><strong>5.	Internet of things (IoT) Security. </strong></p>
                            <p>IoT covers a wide range of different products from everyday appliances, television's and security cameras. These products offer little to none security and this makes them constantly vulnerable to breaches. </p>
                            <p>There are a few benefits of having good cyber security: </p>
                            <p>Business protection against Malware and ransomware.</p>
                            <p>Protection for data and networks. </p>
                            <p>Prevention of unauthorized users. </p>
                            <p>Improves recovery time after being breached. </p>
                            <p>When a company has a strong sense of network security and an effective incident response plan, it is better able to prevent cyber-attacks. For example, end user protection guards against loss or theft while also scanning your computer for any malware code hidden away. </p>

                        </h5>
                      </div>
                      <div id="collapseTwo" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingTwo" data-parent="#accordion">
                        <div class="card-body">
                          <p> Cyber security wouldn’t really impact anything as it’s a defence of the things that would impact it, which would be cyber-crime. Cyber-crime is a ludicrously rich crime which has cost the world billions and can impact a lot of different things depending on what the malware was designed for. Some that can affect how people perceive a business because it was hacked, and private information was stolen all the way to something that could risk human lives like the military systems used today. </p>
                          <p>There are a lot of different groups that would cause a cyber-attack for information but the main ones that are known are:</p>
                          <p> 
							  <li>- Hackers. </li> 
							  <li>- Nation States. </li> 
							  <li>- Terrorists.</li> 
							  <li>- Business Competitors </li>
				  <br></br>
							  <p> Hackers are the main ones that can affect day to day life as they are the ones that create malware and then can sell that information on the “dark web”. Most of the malware they create is used in gathering personal information of the intended targets and they are the ones that have the highest chances of getting financial gain from the attacks. These sorts of attacks would have the most impact on a business because it would affect the customers trust and their income and personal information that is stored. </p>
							  <p>Nation States are the source of more serious attacks, they use a variety of attack that can help them learn national secrets of another country. Others are more aimed to cause disruption of the opposing country which could be more seen as terrorism that would help them gain control of that country during a war. Such as things as shutting off water and power to that country to weaken them.</p>
							    <p>Business Competitors don’t use this style to affect other company very often because corporate espionage is illegal. That doesn’t mean it is used in cases to steal patents and customers information. </p>

                        </h5>
                      </div>
                      <div id="collapseThree" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingThree" data-parent="#accordion">
                        <div class="card-body">
                         <p>A cyber-attack could impact me in a lot of different ways, For example a big one to me would be the loss of trust from friends and family if their personal information and stuff they had told me confidentially was taken without their knowledge and then used against them. Not only that if I run a business and have business information on my computer or phone. </p>
<p>From there it could affect me financially, if the malware was on my main home computer or phone, they could get all my banking details and steal enough information from me to take my savings.  
This would the affect me psychologically because there would always be a blame that I would put on myself because it was my fault that all that information was given out. It would then affect all future relationships and friendships because there would always be the fear of it happening again.</p> 
<p>Then looking long term at if there was some kind of identity theft I would then have to go through all the issues of either sorting my bank out again and changing other personal information, I then would have to look at any other long term damage like credit ratings and debts that have been accrued in my name. </p>
<p>Having any business information given out would then make me lose trust and reputation with customers which would affect me financially and risk being able to get that reputation back and trust back which would affect all future income that I could be looking at. With all the personal information given out I could also lose any potential investors and business of people that were considering using my company. </p>
