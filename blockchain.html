                          <p> Sophia is a social humanoid robot developed in Hong Kong by a company by the name of Hanson Robotics. Sophia became active in February of 2016 and her first official appearance was at a festival in March of 2016 called South by Southwest Festival (SXSW)</p>
                          <p>Sophia is a robot which uses artificial intelligence, visual data processing and facial recognition. Sophia can imitate human facial gestures and make simple conversations on topics that she has been pre-programmed with. Sophia learns to speak through voice recognition technology from Alphabet Inc (they are the parent company of tech powerhouse GOOGLE) over time, Sophia will get smarter. Her ai software was developed by Hanson Robotics. Sophia can analyse conversations and uses that data to then improve her responses in the future. </p>
                          <p>Hanson Robotics had designed Sophia to be a suitable companion for the elderly in nursing homes, or to help crowds at large events of parks. Sophia also currently has nine robot siblings </p>
                          <p><strong>What is the state of the art of this new technology? </strong></p>
                          <p>Sophia has cameras within her eyes which have been combined with computer algorithms which allows her to see. Sophia can follow faces, make eye contact and distinguish individuals from one another. She uses a language sub system to talk, as of 2018 Sophia has been upgraded with functional legs and currently working on her ability to walk. Sophia has a set of pre written questions and answers which gives the illusion that she can talk back. Sophia has also become the first Robot to be given citizenship in Saudi Arabia. This however has brought up some moral questions on the civil rights for human beings. </p>
                          <strong>What can be done now?</strong>
                          <p>AI and humanoids can be used for extensive research into better prosthetics for humans. They are able to be tested and researched to carry out different human tasks. </p>
                          <p>Sophia has been on social media talking back and answering questions from the public. Sophia with her primary build being a personal assistant or to be in an aged care home, could simply become company for individuals who have had poor fortune in life. </p>
                          <p><strong>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
                          <p>Although Sophia has just been given functioning limbs, there has been another version of Sophia called Little Sophia who has been designed for children aged 7 and up. She has been designed to show emotions and have normal conversations and to be a life companion for your children. </p>
                          <p> Hanson robotics wants Little Sophia to be a educational and entertainment based experience for younger students so they are highly-motivated to spend time learning with her. &nbsp;</p>
                          <p><strong>What technological or other developments make this possible?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
                          <p>Having a base model such as Sophia allows Hanson robotics to be able to create new models such as Little Sophia, using the same algorithms and AI software developed on larger models.</p>

                          <p>AI and humanoids can be used for extensive research into better prosthetics for humans. They are able to be tested and researched to carry out different human tasks. 
                            
                            Sophia has been on social media talking back and answering questions from the public. </p>
                          <p>Sophia with her primary build being a personal assistant or to be in an aged care home, could simply become company for individuals who have had poor fortune in life. </p>
                          <p><strong> What is the potential impact of this development?</strong></p>
                          <p> One major psychological problem that humans can face as children as lack of parenting or parents having the time to fulfil a child’s need for human interaction. Sometimes parents have no choice to have day care, or potentially a nanny. But by filling that void with a Robot such as Little Sofia although Hanson Robotics may mean well, this can cause some potentially harmful side effects to the development of a child’s brain and social interaction. 
                            Little Sophia may be able to act and behave like a human and give a form of interaction, but it is not the parent-figure that every child needs, along with friends and family for social interactions. </p>
                          <p>&nbsp;<strong>What is likely to change? </strong></p>
                          <p> The fact that Hanson Robotics is offering children an alternative to social interactions on 24 hours seven days a week basis may have massive changes all depending on the upbringing of that child and how the parents choose to utilise Little Sophia. It could have serious social consequences on that child’s mental development in respect to interactions with others. However this could all be just speculation until we see this on a large scale production. </p>
                          <p> However I am sure this is not Hanson Robotics intentions </p>

                        </h5>
                      </div>
                      <div id="collapseThree" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingThree" data-parent="#accordion">
                        <div class="card-body">
                          <p><strong> Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</strong></p>
                          <p> Depending on just how far Little Sophia goes along with any other models being made for potentially teenagers even adults, this could remove teachers and tutors all together depending on how far the AI software is developed. For some individuals Sophia could become a saving grace as a life companion, this however differs from individual to individual.</p>
                          <p><strong>How will this affect you? In your daily life, how will this affect you? </strong></p>
                          <p>It would not affect me so much in my daily life, the thought of a personal robot assistant would be a great idea if used correctly. The fact that Hanson Technologies is making Robots for educational purposes is a great motive. The only real concern is if individuals with a bad motive got a hold of the prototype, then potentially there could be a serious issue. Using robots for the greater good of humanity is always going to be a positive thing, but like with most things, there are always going to be a few rotten apples What will be different for you? Not much, Robots haven’t become a large factor of anyone’s life that I know of right now. In the future maybe when this becomes a mass production unit, it may affect myself, friends or family members. Until then life is currently robot free.</p>
